/**
 * Development Mode Setup Script
 * 
 * This script would normally set up your Supabase database with tables and initial data.
 * However, the application is currently configured to run in DEVELOPMENT MODE,
 * which means it uses mock data instead of connecting to a real Supabase instance.
 * 
 * To use this script with a real Supabase instance:
 * 
 * 1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
 * 2. Get your project URL and anon key from the project settings
 * 3. Add them to your .env.local file:
 *    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
 *    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
 * 4. Open lib/supabase.js and set FORCE_DEV_MODE = false
 * 5. Run this script with: node setup-database.mjs
 * 
 * For now, you can continue using the application with mock data.
